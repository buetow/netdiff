=head1 NAME

netdiff - A netdiff project

=head1 WTF?

A simple script to diff a file or a directory of two hosts over the network.

This is very helpfull if you want to find out any difference of these two hosts.

=head2 USAGE

Cluster-SSH into two hosts at the same time and run on both hosts the same 
(simultaneous):

    netdiff HOSTNAME PATH 

Where HOSTNAME can be the hostname of the first or the second host. Depending on this the script will decide to be the client or the server role.

And where PATH musst be a full qualified path to a file or a directory.

Netdiff transfers everything in PATH (recursively and encrypted via OpenSSL/AES) to the other host and computes a diff of it.

=head2 EXAMPLE

A common use case is to find out the differences of the PAM configuration. On most systems the PAM configuration is spread into several small configuration files which are hard to compare by hand between two hosts. 

Given two hosts one.example.com and two.example.com. Just run this command on both hosts:

  netdiff one.example.com /etc/pam.d

The same affect, but the other way around would be the following command:

  netdiff two.example.com /etc/pam.d
