NAME
    netdiff - A netdiff project

WTF?
    A simple script to diff two files via the network.

  usage
    ClusterSSH onto two hosts at the same time and run on both hosts the
    same command like:

        netdiff HOSTNAME FILENAME

    Where HOSTNAME can be the hostname of the first or the second host.
    Depending on this the script will decide to be the client or the server
    role.
